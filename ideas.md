Would be cool to have times on it

# Rules
Not a kill if it’s a foul leading to a free throw
If it was a block, capture that and who
  - Block is “block” followed by “rebound def”
It it was a steal, capture that and who
  - Steal us “turnover” followed by “steal”
Capture time started and ended
- Related this, note time since last stop streak/kill
NOT A KILL if the possession came after a missed FT

## Is a play a stop?
  - def rebound (EXCEPT IF IT WAS A FT BEFORE)
    - was there a block the play before?

  - turnover by the offense
    - need to know if it was a charge, previous play will be a foul on that same player
  - steal by the defense

## Does a play end a stop streak?
 - made basket by the opposition
 - possible caveat - foul leading to free throws
	will be foul followed by FT or followed by subs then FT

## Things that indicate makes
 - good

# Play by Play data
What it could give - things like when a player scored see if a player scores in bursts or not
Traditional box scores only give fast break points as happening after a turnover or defensive rebound. I want to know how many “quick points” are scored, i.e. how many times you score fast off of a make

Could make up new stats like “impact steals” being steals that lead to points within 7 seconds or something like that

“Critical Turnovers”
Ones that happen when the game is within 5 and/or with a certain amount of time left in the game
Could even tier it to what seems reasonable (down 5-8 with 4 minutes left)

Could essentially track everything about the team/player. For instance, when did the turnovers happen, when did a player score their points, etc

Something like this evenhttps://cbbstatistics.blogspot.com/2020/08/does-high-minutes-average-cause.html

Lineups stuff
+/- for players
Stats for players
A more intuitive lineup thing where you can see who’s on the court and stuff (run etc)
Can do assisted buckets and assist maps here too

General box score fun times
How many threes were made by different players
How many different players had an assist
