Some ideas for where to go from here

# Sequential Lineup View
Recreate the whole substitution pattern of the whole game

# Lineup Tracer
Add a little link on the bbottom to go to the next lnieup or previous lineup

# Lineups vs top Competition
Filter the minutes and stuff to lineups aganist the best, worst or whatever range youo want competition

# Might need to look at making
  - The selectors smaller, they take up a lot of space rn 
  - Only show players that are actually in the the current game
